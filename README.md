# What is it
This is a very `simple python chatbot` using the NLP alghoritm. It connects to an `Wit.AI` app using `pywit` module. By default it connects to my app, but you can change the ID in the file.

# Installation
Setup a `Discord Application` on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and put it in the DISCORD_TOKEN variable. If you don't know how to do any of these steps you shouldn't even be using this chat bot tbh... Anyways, once you've done that, get your Wit App's client token from app settings and put it in the WIT_TOKEN variable. BOT_CHANNEL_ID should be pretty straightforward.

# Issues
Q: ***I got an issue/enhancement/suggestion/idea/improvement***, what do i do?
A: Create a new github issue.

Q: ***I want to contribute***, what do i do?
A: There are 2 ways to contribute, one of which is to ***just use the app***. It improves overtime as I validate responses, which means that I can see ***everything*** you type in the channel. The second way is to create a pull request, but before you do ***please*** validate that everything is working ok

# TODO
- Improve the installation tutorial as it may be confusing for ~~normies~~ users
- Get valid responses to messages from a database
- Voice Channel support (help wanted)
- More entities and more difficult tasks, such as asking for the weather in France.
